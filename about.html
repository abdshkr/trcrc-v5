                    <p>The loss of biodiversity is one of the greatest environmental challenges the world faces. In
                        Malaysia logging, agriculture, palm oil and development have all contributed to increased
                        forest fragmentation and species loss. Approximately 80% of Malaysian rainforests are
                        dominated by the Dipterocarpaceae family of trees, of which 93 species are considered
                        threatened in Malaysia.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Dipterocarps have a unique biology and a slow reproductive cycle. Seeds are produced
                    during mast fruiting events which occur every 5-7 years, and the seeds are ‘recalcitrant’ –
                    their high-water content makes them unsuitable for storage (e.g. in a seed bank), and thus
                    must be germinated. Recalcitrant seeds rescued from forest fragments can be planted out
                    with seeds from different parents to create a living collection of trees that can reproduce
                    perpetually. Seeds from the living collection could then serve future reforestation projects.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Tropical Rainforest Conservation and Research Centre (TRCRC) was established in 2012 to
                    restore tropical rainforests and address the critical rate of biodiversity loss in Malaysia.
                    TRCRC’s Mission is two-fold: to preserve tropical rainforest plant species and lead
                    landscape-wide protection and reforestation projects throughout the country.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    TRCRC plans to reconnect forest fragments through the reforestation of degraded patches
                    using native trees sourced from nurseries as well as seedlings from rescued threatened
                    plants. It serves two important national conservation policies: ex-situ conservation for the
                    preservation of plant species and genetic diversity under the National Biodiversity plan, and
                    the Heart of Borneo initiative, to support Malaysia’s commitments towards conservation.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Tropical Rainforest Conservation & Research Centre (TRCRC), established on 1st
                            November 2012, is a company limited by guarantee operating as a non-governmental
                            organisation (NGO). Founded by YABhg. Tun Jeanne Abdullah, TRCRC focuses on the
                            restoration of tropical rainforests in Malaysia.</p>
                        <br>    
                        <p>Driven by her passion for forests and its many benefits, YABhg. Tun Jeanne first
                            established Landskap Malaysia, sister company to TRCRC, with the hope of creating a
                            Malaysian society ingrained with a culture of caring for and appreciating our natural
                            landscape and rainforest.</p>
                        <br>     
                        <p>Recognising that raising awareness and on-the-ground action go hand in hand, TRCRC
                            was then initiated to address the critical rate of biodiversity loss in Malaysia, through
                            establishing ex-situ conservation sites, known as Tropical Rainforest Living Collections.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>With a dedicated team and through strategic partnerships, TRCRC has since grown and
                            expanded its portfolio with the goal of making a bigger impact in forest conservation.</p>
